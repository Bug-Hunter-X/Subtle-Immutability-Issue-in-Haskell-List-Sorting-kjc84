```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code snippet appears to be straightforward: it imports the `sort` function from `Data.List`, defines a list `xs`, sorts it using `sort`, and then prints the sorted list `ys`. However, a subtle error exists that may not be immediately apparent to beginners in Haskell.

The potential error lies in the use of `let` bindings.  While this code will compile and run correctly, the `let` bindings create new values, rather than updating existing ones.  If the intention was to mutate `xs` by sorting it in place, this approach is incorrect. Lists in Haskell are immutable; the `sort` function returns a *new* sorted list. The original `xs` list remains unchanged.

This is a classic misunderstanding for programmers coming from imperative backgrounds.  Many languages have 'in-place' sorting, but Haskell does not; it leverages immutability, hence the necessity of creating a new sorted list.
